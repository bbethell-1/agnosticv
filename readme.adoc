= Agnostic Vars

== Description

Agnosticv is a generic way of organizing and merging YAML files to manage a Catalog.

Currently the project is composed of:

. link:cli[CLI] `agnosticv`, a generic implementation.
. link:https://github.com/redhat-gpte-devopsautomation/agnosticv-operator[agnosticv-operator] an OpenShift operator that uses the CLI and generates OpenShift Custom Resources for link:https://github.com/redhat-cop/babylon[Babylon] based on the content of the agnosticv repositories. The operator is more opinionated than the CLI as it expects a specific file structure in the agnosticV repository. We use it to manage the catalog of our demo portal RHPDS.

=== Features ===

- Merge YAML files automatically following a particular convention, see below.
- Support for includes.
- Validate variables using  link:https://www.openapis.org/[OpenAPI v3] schemas. Just place schemas in a `.schemas` directory at the top-level of the agnosticv repository.
- Customize merge strategies
- Inject information about last change (commit, author, date) when merging the vars of a catalog item
- When listing catalog items, filter catalog items using JMESPath expressions (`--has` flag)

== `agnosticv` CLI

=== Install

Download the binary for your architecture (linux, mac, windows, ..) from link:https://github.com/redhat-cop/agnosticv/releases/[release page].

=== Usage

The CLI `agnosticv` has the following capabilities:

- list all the catalog items present in a directory
- merge and print the vars of an item of the catalog


.Usage
----
Usage of agnosticv:
  -debug
    	Debug mode
  -git
    	Perform git operations to gather and inject information into the merged vars like 'last_update'. Git operations are slow so this option is automatically disabled for listing. (default true)
  -has value
    	Use with --list only. Filter catalog items using a JMESPath expression.
    	Can be used several times (act like AND).

    	Examples:
    	--has __meta__.catalog
    	--has "env_type == 'ocp-clientvm'"
    	--has "to_string(worker_instance_count) == '2'"

  -list
    	List all the catalog items present in current directory.
  -merge string
    	Merge and print variables of a catalog item.
  -or-related value
    	Use with --list only. Same as --related except it appends the related files to the list instead of reducing it.

    	Example:
    	--list --related dir/common.yaml --or-related includes/foo.yaml
    	   List all catalog items under dir/ and also all catalog items that include includes/foo.yaml

    	Can be used several times (act like OR).
  -related value
    	Use with --list only. Filter output and display only related catalog items.
    	A catalog item is related to FILE if:
    	- it includes FILE as a common file
    	- it includes FILE via #include
    	- FILE is description.adoc or description.html

    	Example:
    	--list --related dir/common.yaml --related includes/foo.yaml
    	   List all catalog items under dir/ that also include includes/foo.yaml

    	Can be used several times (act like AND).
  -root string
    	The top directory of the agnosticv files. Files outside of this directory will not be merged.
    	By default, it's empty, and the scope of the git repository is used, so you should not
    	need this parameter unless your files are not in a git repository, or if you want to use a subdir. Use -root flag with -merge.
  -validate
    	Validate variables against schemas present in .schemas directory. (default true)
  -version
    	Print build version.

--------------

NOTE: `common.yaml` files are always included when merging. `agnosticv` searches for those files as long as it is in the same git repository. If the files are not versioned with git, it is possible to "chroot" the search using the `--root` parameter.

== Build

----
cd cli
go get
go build -o agnosticv

== File naming convention

=== Nomenclature ===

* _Catalog item_, or _Leaf_: a file considered a catalog item. It appears when listing an agnosticv repository with `agnosticv --list`. To print the content of a catalog item, you run `agnosticv --merge PATH`. That merges common files, meta files, included files, and finally, the leaf to produce the catalog item.
* _Common file_:  a file that is automatically included in the merge list. Ex: `common.yaml`
* _Included file_: any file that is included in the merge list using the `#include PATH` feature
* _Meta file_: Any file ending with `.meta.yml` or `.meta.yaml`. It contains the value of the `__meta__` dictionary.

=== Common files ===

Some files are automatically included in the merge list to produce the final catalog item. The following names are valid common YAML files:

- `common.yaml`
- `common.yml`
- `account.yaml`
- `account.yml`

They can be placed at any level in the agnosticv repository.

=== Includes ===

Files included in the merge list using the `#include PATH` feature. See the dedicated section below.

Usually, we place them in an `includes/` directory at the top of the agnosticv repository.

==== `#include` merge feature ====

* syntax:  `#include FILENAME`
* where: In any file
* identation is ignored
+
[source,yaml]
----
#include /file.yaml
----
+
And:
+
[source,yaml]
----
    #include /file.yaml
----
+
are the same.
* `FILENAME` is added to the merge list right **before** current file regardless of the position of `#include` in the file. In other words, current file vars take precedence over included files vars.
** That's also why you should put all your includes at the top of the file.
* if `FILENAME` starts with `/` then path is absolute to the AgnosticV repo.
** if not, the path is relative to the current file

===== Example =====

[source,yaml]
.`gpte/OCP4_WORKSHOP/prod.yaml`
----
#include /includes/file1.yaml
#include /includes/file2.yaml

cloud_provider: ec2
key_name: opentlc_admin_backdoor
repo_method: file

subdomain_base_suffix: .example.opentlc.com
HostedZoneId: Z3IHLWJZOU9SRT

agnosticv_meta:
  deploy_with: babylon
----

[source,yaml]
.`includes/file1.yaml` with vars at the "agnosticd" level
----
var1: value1
var2: value2
----

[source,yaml]
.`includes/file2.yaml` with meta vars
----
agnosticv_meta:
  secrets:
    - somesecret

__meta__:
  secrets:
    - name: somesecret
      namespace: gpte
----

The merge list will be:

. `/common.yaml`
. `/gpte/account.yaml`
. `/gpte/OCP4_WORKSHOP/common.yaml`
. `/includes/file1.yaml`
. `/includes/file2.yaml`
. `/gpte/OCP4_WORKSHOP/prod.yaml`

=== Meta files ===

For any common file, leaf file, or included file, you can create an associated meta file to be automatically included.
The meta file can contain the value of the  `\\__meta__` dictionary. It is convenient to separate that special dictionary from the other variables.

For example, the following files are valid meta files:

* `common.meta.yml` meta file for `common.yml`
* `account.meta.yml` meta file for `account.yml`
* `dev.meta.yml` meta file for `dev.yml`

WARNING: you can only put the content of the `\\__meta__` variable in a meta file.

.example1: content of meta file
[source,yaml]
----
__meta__:
  secrets:
    - name: mysecret
----

.example2: with the content of `\\__meta__` directly, same as example1
[source,yaml]
----
secrets:
  - name: mysecret
----

.example3: *wrong* meta file - This will fail
[source,yaml]
----
__meta__:
  secrets:
    - name: mysecret

another_var: value <1>
----
<1> other variables than `\\__meta__` are not allowed

=== Leaf files ===

The "leaf" files, or catalog items, are just the rest of the YAML files, having one of these extensions:

- yml
- yaml

You can list all catalog items in a directory by using `--list` parameter: `agnosticv --list`

==== Files ignored ====

* Any dotfile is ignored. Ex: `.git`
* Any directory named `includes` is reserved to includes. The files in those directories are never considered as catalog items.
* Any file containing:
+
----
#agnosticv catalog_item false
----
+
is ignored. It is not considered a catalog item.



== Merging strategies

=== Default ===

When it comes to merging variables, there are different possible strategies.

The default is the following:

|========================
| What | Dictionaries | Lists | Strings / Numbers

|`\\__meta__` and `agnosticv_meta` dictionaries
| **merge**
| **append**
| **replace**

| Rest of the vars

Same behavior as if you were using ansible{nbsp}extra{nbsp}vars

| **replace**
| **replace**
| **replace**
|========================

=== Custom merge strategies ===

It is possible to extend agnosticV and define the merge strategy to use on what variable or part of a dictionary variable.

To do that, you can define the custom merge strategies in any schema in the `.schemas` directory. Just use the **`x-merge`** keyword at the beginning of the schema. `x-merge` is a list of strategies. Each strategy defines a `path` and a `strategy` name to apply to that path. `path` is a link:https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6901[JSON Pointer]. For the list of strategies, see section below.

[source,yaml]
.`.schema/schema.yaml`  example of `x-merge` custom strategy
----
type: object
x-merge:
  - path: /__meta__/access_control # <1>
    strategy: overwrite # <2>
properties:
----
<1> The path of the variable or key of dictionnary, as a link:https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6901[JSON Pointer], to apply the custom strategy against.
<2> When merging, agnosticv will overwrite the content of `\\__meta__.access_control` instead of merging it.

For example, with the schema above and following merge list:

----
# MERGED:
# fixtures/common.yaml
# fixtures/test/account.yaml
# fixtures/test/BABYLON_EMPTY_CONFIG/common.yaml
# fixtures/test/BABYLON_EMPTY_CONFIG/prod.yaml
----

The value of `\\__meta__.access_control` from `prod.yaml` will take precedence and overwrite.

Here are the available custom merge strategies:

|========================
| Strategy | Can be applied to | Dictionaries | Lists | Strings / Numbers

| `overwrite`
| List or Dict
| **replace**
| **replace**
| **replace**

| `merge`
| List or Dict
| **Merge**
| **Append**
| **replace**

| `merge-no-append`
| Dict
| **Merge**
| **replace**
| **replace**

| `strategic-merge`
| List or Dict
| **Strategic Merge** footnote:strategic-merge[Merge similar to kubernetes link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/manage-kubernetes-objects/update-api-object-kubectl-patch/#notes-on-the-strategic-merge-patch[stategic merge patch]. The patch merge-key for list is `name`.]
| **Strategic Merge** footnote:strategic-merge[]
| **replace**
